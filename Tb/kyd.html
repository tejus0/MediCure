            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). 

Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.

rs usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.

   <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Cancer is a complicated disease. You can have cancer for years without developing symptoms. Other times, cancer may cause noticeable symptoms that get worse very quickly. Many cancer symptoms resemble other, less serious illnesses. Having certain symptoms doesn’t mean you have cancer. In general, you should talk to a healthcare provider anytime there’s a change in your body that lasts for more than two weeks.

First symptoms of cancer
Some common early cancer symptoms include:

Unexplained weight loss.
Chronic tiredness.
Persistent pain.
Fever that occurs mostly at night.
Skin changes, particularly moles that change shape and size or new moles.
Left untreated, cancer may cause additional symptoms, including:

Bruising or bleeding more easily.
Lumps or bumps under your skin that don’t go away.
Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty swallowing
              </p>
           <p>Cancer can cause many symptoms, but these symptoms are most often caused by illness, injury, benign tumors, or other problems. If you have symptoms that do not get better after a few weeks, see your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Often, cancer does not cause pain, so do not wait to feel pain before seeing a doctor. 

            To learn more about symptoms for a specific cancer, see the list of PDQ® cancer treatment summaries for adult and childhood cancers. Each summary includes detailed information about symptoms caused by a specific cancer.</p>
            </p>
            <p>No matter your age or health, it’s good to know the possible signs of cancer. By themselves, they aren’t enough to diagnose the disease. But they can be clues for you and your doctor so that you can find and treat the problem as soon as possible. Treatment works best early on, when a tumor is small and hasn’t spread.

              These symptoms don’t always mean cancer. Lots of common conditions can make you feel this way. It’s important to see your doctor so they can take a closer look at your health and take action.</p>

              <h3>Causes</h3>
              <p>
                The main cause of cancer is mutations, or changes to the DNA in your cells. Genetic mutations can be inherited. They can also occur after birth as a result of environmental forces.

These external causes, called carcinogens, can include:

physical carcinogens like radiation and ultraviolet (UV) light
chemical carcinogens like cigarette smoke, asbestos, alcohol, air pollution, and contaminated food and drinking water
biological carcinogens like viruses, bacteria, and parasites
According to the WHOTrusted Source, about 33 percent of cancer deaths may be caused by tobacco, alcohol, high body mass index (BMI), low fruit and vegetable consumption, and not getting enough physical activity.
              </p>
              <p>Over one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%). These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.</p>

   <h3>Home Remedies</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              1. Don't use tobacco
Smoking has been linked to many types of cancer, including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, voice box, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Even being around secondhand smoke might increase the risk of lung cancer.

But it's not only smoking that's harmful. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the mouth, throat and pancreas.

Staying away from tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important way to help prevent cancer. For help quitting tobacco, ask a health care provider about stop-smoking products and other ways of quitting.

<p>2. Eat a healthy diet
  Although eating healthy foods can't ensure cancer prevention, it might reduce the risk. Consider the following:
  
  Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods. Limit refined sugars and fat from animal sources.
  Drink alcohol only in moderation, if at all. Alcohol increases the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney and liver. Drinking more increases the risk.
  Limit processed meats. Eating processed meat often can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer. 
  </p> 
  <p>3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active
    Being at a healthy weight might lower the risk of some types of cancer. These include cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon and kidney.
    
    Physical activity counts too. Besides helping control weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.

          <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
          <p>
            Your doctor may use one or more approaches to diagnose cancer:

Physical exam. Your doctor may feel areas of your body for lumps that may indicate cancer. During a physical exam, your doctor may look for abnormalities, such as changes in skin color or enlargement of an organ, that may indicate the presence of cancer.
Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests, such as urine and blood tests, may help your doctor identify abnormalities that can be caused by cancer. For instance, in people with leukemia, a common blood test called complete blood count may reveal an unusual number or type of white blood cells.
Imaging tests. Imaging tests allow your doctor to examine your bones and internal organs in a noninvasive way. Imaging tests used in diagnosing cancer may include a computerized tomography (CT) scan, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, ultrasound and X-ray, among others.
Biopsy. During a biopsy, your doctor collects a sample of cells for testing in the laboratory. There are several ways of collecting a sample. Which biopsy procedure is right for you depends on your type of cancer and its location. In most situations, a biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose cancer.

In the laboratory, doctors look at cell samples under the microscope. Normal cells look uniform, with similar sizes and orderly organization. Cancer cells look less orderly, with varying sizes and without apparent organization.
